This time we're trying out a new format of our meetings. There will be no well-defined presentations, and instead "bring your own topic". If you're interested in anything related to the Kotlin ecosystem, or have a complex problem where could you cloud pick brains of more experienced Kotlin developers, it may be a good candidate for a topic to start on the meeting! It's also a good opportunity to exchange experience in a free discussion.

Some ideas for the topics to discuss:
- https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx-rpc, the new first-party library for RPC
- update on the progress of working at https://github.com/typesafegithub/github-workflows-kt - new features, recent API cleanup

See you there!
