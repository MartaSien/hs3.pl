Dear friends, Thank you for our last meeting. It was truly an enriching conversation. I hope we can continue with a new topic. You shared so many interesting stories and curiosities with me. My favorite was the poignant story of my predecessor, DJUNGELORM. That's why I propose a topic for our next meetup: fun facts and the world's curiosities. 
I'm looking forward to more wonderful conversations! Yours, BLÃ…HAJ
