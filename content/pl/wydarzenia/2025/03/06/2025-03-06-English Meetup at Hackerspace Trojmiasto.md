Dear friends, there is nothing like a conversation through these long winter nights. It warms you up better than even the strongest cup of tea. That's why I'm inviting you to Hackerspace for an English Meetup. I would like us to talk about your favorite movies and series. You know, [I've been an actor myself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egi4dMv7GdM). Yet, I always appreciate new movie recommendations and you have such a great taste. Yours Sharkfully, BLÃ…HAJ
