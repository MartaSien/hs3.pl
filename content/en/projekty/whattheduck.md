titla: "What the duck?"
---

Created during the **Illuminathon** hackathon, this project transforms **yellow rubber duckies** and a **pizza box** into a unique and unconventional display screen. Each duck is strategically mounted to serve as an individual pixel, with the setup powered by a microcomputer that controls various light effects, resulting in a highly distinctive and playful visual display.

The ultimate goal is to allow the project to display **text** and **images**, with each rubber ducky functioning as a single pixel. The result is an engaging, whimsical display that's both entertaining and surprisingly captivating.

This project cleverly merges **humor** with **technology**, showing how simple everyday items like rubber duckies and a pizza box can be repurposed into something interactive, visually striking, and full of personality.
