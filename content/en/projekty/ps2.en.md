## PlayStation and the Youngtimer Section
PlayStation is a household name, and its legacy is on display here at Hackerspace Tr√≥jmiasto's Youngtimer Section. Among the collection, one of the most intriguing pieces is the GunCon controller, a unique device that offers a fascinating look into how technology has evolved.

## How the GunCon Works
The GunCon controller was designed to work with CRT television screens, a technology that differs significantly from modern displays. The image on a CRT screen is made up of hundreds of thin horizontal lines, drawn sequentially from top to bottom, left to right. However, at any given moment, only one of these lines is actually illuminated.
Despite this, our eyes perceive a continuous image across the entire screen due to a phenomenon called persistence of vision. This ability of the human eye to combine sequentially drawn images into a single picture allows us to experience smooth motion on screens, even though the screen is lighting up in intervals.

## Why the GunCon Is Special
Unlike the human eye, which can't distinguish events happening dozens of times per second, machines like the GunCon controller can. When you aim at the screen, a photodiode in the controller detects the light more precisely than our eyes can. By identifying whether a specific area of the screen is lit at a given moment, it can accurately determine your target.

## The Impact of Modern Technology
As a fun fact, modern LCD screens operate based on a completely different technology. Their refresh rate and the way they display images prevent controllers like the GunCon from functioning as they originally did on CRT screens. This is a testament to how far technology has come, and how innovations once cutting-edge can become obsolete with new advancements.
This retro technology continues to fascinate, offering a glimpse into the unique engineering solutions of the past.
