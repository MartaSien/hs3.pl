Neon signs have captivated us since their inception. Many people dream of having a small neon sign in their home, office, or bar. Unfortunately, the process of creating real neon signs (using noble gases to produce light) is complex, and these signs are costly to maintain.

## LEDons – a simpler alternative
Thankfully, there's a cheaper and easier solution that, while not quite the same, comes pretty close to capturing the charm of traditional neon. These are LEDons – creations made from LED strips and special diffusers designed to mimic the look of classic neon signs.

## How to create your own LEDon?
The easiest way to start is with flexible LED strips, transparent plexiglass, and a few tools for cutting, gluing, and soldering. With some creativity and a good idea, you can craft a unique LEDon in just a few hours. For instance, the glowing lightbulb featured here set a record, taking only about an hour to complete!

## Workshops at Hackerspace Trójmiasto
The LEDons on display were made during workshops periodically held at Hackerspace Trójmiasto. If you'd like to create your own glowing masterpiece, get in touch with us – we’d be happy to come up with something special together!
