"Project Glitter," also known as the "Glitterophone," "Bottle Piano," or humorously "Battle Piano" (though we don't suggest testing its durability in combat), is a unique musical instrument that combines creativity, coding, and craftsmanship.

This innovative project was born during the 2023 MusicJam hackathon hosted by IKM. Over the span of just 8 hours, everyday materials—bottles, glitter, wires, and microcontrollers—were transformed into a fully functional instrument. Its creators showcased their work with a live solo performance during the final concert.

## How it works:
Each bottle represents one of the white keys on a piano. Pressing a bottle cap triggers a custom synthesizer (coded in Python) to produce the corresponding note. To enhance the visual experience, the pressed bottles illuminate, highlighting their glittering decorations and adding a magical touch to the performance.

"Project Glitter" embodies the fusion of art and technology, demonstrating how simple materials can be turned into an unforgettable interactive experience.
