title: "CyberVenus and the HS3 CyberWear Collection"
---

CyberVenus is the centerpiece of the HS3 CyberWear collection, a futuristic fashion line created at Hackerspace Trójmiasto as part of experiments leading up to the Light Festival. This collection combines technology and style, offering both eye-catching design and practical innovation.

## The Glowing T-shirt
At the heart of the collection is a t-shirt featuring a 16x16 pixel display capable of displaying animations, text, or even videos. During testing, the shirt famously played Rick Astley's "Never Gonna Give You Up," and viewers had no trouble recognizing the video. The display and controller are housed in a removable pocket, making the shirt washable and iron-safe. Whether you're heading to a party or just want to stand out, this glowing t-shirt offers both style and functionality.

## The Anti-Choker
The second item in the collection, the Anti-choker, is as practical as it is innovative. This accessory monitors air quality and alerts wearers to potentially harmful conditions.
- **Green**: The air is safe to breathe.
- **Orange**: Air quality is declining.
- **Red**: Poor air quality—time to ventilate or move to a safer location.

With its built-in sensor and LED indicators, the Anti-choker is both a statement piece and a personal health monitor.

The HS3 CyberWear collection invites everyone to explore the fusion of technology and fashion. If you’re ready to shine or breathe easy in style, visit Hackerspace Trójmiasto and create your own cyber-inspired wearable!
